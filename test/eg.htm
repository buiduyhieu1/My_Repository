    <p>If you wish to use WinRAR and RAR after the evaluation period of 40 days,
        you need to purchase its license from one of the regional dealers
        <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/registration.php">listed here</a>.
        You can also check the latest price list and buy on-line at
        <a href="http://www.rarlab.com">www.rarlab.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Upon receipt of your registration fee you will receive an email
        containing a registration key file corresponding to the user name
        string which you have chosen. Please specify a valid email address
        when buying the licence, as it will be used to send you the key file.</p>

    <p>The registration email will also contain all necessary instructions,
        so please just follow them. Below, we provide a brief explanation of
        the typical registration procedure, but instructions in the email are
        more up to date than this file and should thus have a higher precedence.</p>

    <p>If you use WinRAR, you will need to copy the registration key file
        (rarreg.key) to a WinRAR folder or to %APPDATA%\WinRAR folder.
        By default WinRAR folder is "C:\Program Files\WinRAR", but it can be
        changed by a user when installing WinRAR.
    </p>

    <p>If the key is archived in a .rar or .zip file, please extract
        rarreg.key from the archive before copying it.</p>

    <p>If you use RAR/Unix and RAR for OS X, you should copy rarreg.key
        to your home directory or to one of the following directories:
        /etc, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/etc. You may rename it
        to .rarreg.key or .rarregkey, if you wish, but rarreg.key is also valid.</p>
